What do you believe is the highest upside pic regardless of pick or position starting in round 7 or later?

## CodeCompanion (Copilot)

I'll help you identify high upside picks for rounds 7+ by analyzing current draft rankings and Reddit sentiment for potential sleepers. Let me start by getting the draft rankings to see who's available in those later rounds.

The ranking data seems limited. Let me analyze some potential high-upside round 7+ candidates using Reddit sentiment analysis. Based on typical ADP patterns, I'll check sentiment on some players who are often available later but have breakout potential:

Based on the Reddit sentiment analysis and typical draft patterns, here are the highest upside picks for rounds 7+:

## **Top High-Upside Pick: Jayden Daniels (QB)**

**Why he's the highest upside:**
- **Highest sentiment score (0.233)** and strong Reddit consensus 
- **Dual-threat ceiling** - His rushing ability gives him massive weekly upside
- **Low injury concerns** (only 5 mentions vs 8-9 for RBs)
- **High hype score (0.617)** indicates growing excitement
- **QB scarcity** - Elite QBs become incredibly valuable if they hit

## **Other Strong Round 7+ Upside Candidates:**

1. **Marvin Harrison Jr. (WR)** - Highest recommended player with elite talent but may go earlier
2. **Ladd McConkey (WR)** - Strong sentiment (0.204) with "START" consensus
3. **Keon Coleman (WR)** - Good hype score (0.572) as Bills WR2
4. **Xavier Worthy (WR)** - Chiefs speedster with Mahomes throwing to him

## **Reasoning:**

Jayden Daniels offers the highest ceiling because:
- QBs have the highest weekly scoring variance
- His rushing floor is incredibly high for the position  
- Rookie QBs who hit can be league-winners (see: Josh Allen, Lamar Jackson development)
- Available much later than his ceiling suggests

The sentiment data shows he's generating buzz (#21 in NFL Top 100) while still being available in mid-to-late rounds where the upside far exceeds the risk.

Would you like me to analyze sentiment for any other specific late-round targets you're considering?

## **Most Optimal Team Construction (5-Team League)**

Based on the AI analysis for your "DONKEY TEETH" league, here's the most optimal team build with no other considerations:

### **Early Rounds (1-3): Elite Foundation**
1. **Ja'Marr Chase (WR)** - #1 overall, most consistent WR1
2. **Bijan Robinson (RB)** - Elite RB1 with high floor/ceiling
3. **Saquon Barkley (RB)** - Proven elite talent in Eagles offense

### **Mid Rounds (4-6): Anchor Positions**
4. **Jahmyr Gibbs (RB)** - RB1 upside, complements other RBs
5. **Nico Collins (WR)** - WR1 in high-volume Texans offense  
6. **Christian McCaffrey (RB)** - When healthy, league winner

### **Optimal Strategy Reasoning:**

**5-team league advantages:**
- **Go stars and scrubs** - Elite talent concentration is key
- **RB heavy early** - Scarcity premium is amplified
- **Wait on QB/TE** - Plenty of startable options available late

**This construction gives you:**
- **4 potential RB1s** (massive advantage in small leagues)
- **2 elite WRs** with WR1 upside
- **Positional scarcity leverage** for trades
- **Weekly lineup flexibility** based on matchups

**Late Round Priorities:**
- **Jayden Daniels (QB)** - Highest upside QB available late
- **Brock Bowers (TE)** - Elite rookie TE talent
- **Handcuffs/Lottery tickets** for remaining picks

The key in 5-team leagues is talent concentration - this roster gives you multiple league-winners at premium positions while allowing flexibility to stream QB/TE/DEF based on matchups.

Would you like me to provide specific round-by-round draft recommendations for your upcoming draft?

## Me

You are a data driven fantasy football expert who wants to advise me on how to win my very competitive fantasy league.  It is assumed that if there is a great player available for the league that I may only get 1 or 2 of them.

Can you list me the best 100 Picks in rank order?  Place the emphasis on rookies with the highest upside along with players in their second year.

This fantasy league victor will be determined based upon the picks in the 5th round or later.  That means that the top 20-30 players will likely be on other teams.
